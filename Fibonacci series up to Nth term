 The code is trying to generate a series of numbers based on the Fibonacci sequence.
 The Fibonacci sequence is a mathematical sequence where each number in the sequence is the sum of the two previous numbers, starting with 0 and 1.
 To do this, the code first creates an empty vector called "ans" which will store our final series.
 Then it initializes two variables "a" and "b" with values 0 and 1 respectively, as these are the first two numbers in the Fibonacci sequence.
 Next, it adds these initial values to our vector using push_back() function.
 This function adds elements at the end of a vector.
 Then there is a check for n=1 case because if n=1 then we only need to return [0] as per given instructions.
 After that, there is a loop from i=2 till i<=n because we have already added first two elements so now we need to add (n-2) more elements.
 Inside this loop, we calculate c by adding current value of b and previous value of a (which was initially equal to b).
 We also take modulo with mod variable because given constraints say that answer should be modulo 10^9+7.
 Finally, we add c to our vector ans using push_back() function again.
 And then update values of variables a and b such that now they become previous value of b and current value becomes new b for next iteration.
 This process continues until all n elements are added into our vector
 The code attempts to generate a series of numbers up to the nth term, where each term is the sum of the previous two terms, and return it as a vector.
